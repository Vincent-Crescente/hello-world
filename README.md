Hello, I'm Vincent Crescente and I will graduate with a Bachelors of Computer Science in June 2018. I look forward to studying the specific field of computer science I would like to enter before applying to certian jobs. As of now I enjoy learning about web design and what about a website makes it captivating or emotion driven. I also enjoy learning about object oriented programming, organization and clarity are enjoyable to implement which comes with OOP.
